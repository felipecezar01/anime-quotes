## Orochimaru

> **"I want to obtain all the jutsu and gain a true understanding of everything in this world. The first one to mix blue and yellow called the new color 'green'. I want to do something similar to that. If blue is the chakra, then yellow is the seal, and green is the jutsu... Just as there is no end to the variety of colors, there are so many thousands... tens of thousands of jutsu in the world as well. But in order to obtain every possible jutsu and truth, it would require an eternity. Only one who understands everything after spending such time on this can be fittingly called the Ultimate Being."**
